Hello, Iâ€™m Shakeel! Iâ€™m a visual designer from Seattle, specializing in branding and experimental typography. After 10 years of working as a software engineer, I began exploring my creative side. I am an MFA in Graphic Design student at ArtCenter College of Design, with the intent of learning more about typography, branding, and design leadership.
