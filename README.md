# Hello, Iâ€™m Shakeel! 

![Shakeel Mohamed black and white headshot](./opengraph-default.png)

Iâ€™m a Graphic Design MFA Candidate at ArtCenter College of Design. In my software career, I collaborated with designers so often I began to think like one. Before realizing my love of brand identity, I found design through streetwear fashion. During my graduate studies, I am exploring how graphic design can be applied across media and disciplines.

If any of this sounds interesting, please reach out by email, LinkedIn, or Instagram. I enjoy discussing design and professional growth with people at any stage of their careers.
