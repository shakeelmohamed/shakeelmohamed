# Hello, I‚Äôm Shakeel!

**I think inside, outside, and about the box itself.**

I thrive at the intersection of cultures, translating across perspectives to discover new ideas. My elementary school was on a Native American reservation where I was ‚Äúthe other Indian.‚Äù Early in life, I understood the nuances of personal identity which primed me for my second career in graphic design.

The pursuit of mastery fuels everything I do. As a software engineer, I didn‚Äôt just write code; I crafted it to be efficient and elegantly formatted, making it intuitive for other developers. This attention to typography is now at the heart of my practice as a designer. My creative process is a synthesis of research, conversational insights, strategy, and empathy to connect with my audience.
